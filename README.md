# Nexus Media Player

A video player for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org). It keeps your movies and TV shows in
a library, remembers where you stopped, and plays them with mpv. It takes its colors
from your Omarchy theme and fits a half-screen tile.

## What it does

- **Library:** scans your video folders (MKV, MP4, WebM, AVI, MOV, WMV, TS, MPEG, OGV and
  more) into a local database. Later scans only read new or changed files, and it picks
  up videos added, removed or renamed within a minute.
  - **Home:** what you were last watching in a banner over its backdrop, Continue
    watching (with Remove from Continue watching), the next episode of each show you're
    following, and what was added lately.
  - **Movies:** a poster grid, sorted by title, year, date added or rating, with
    watched and unwatched filters (both remembered). Each movie has a page with its details and file info.
  - **TV shows:** shows, seasons (with Play season) and episodes (with Mark watched up
    to here), found from file names
    (`Show S01E02.mkv`, `Show 1x02.mkv`) or folders (`Show/Season 1/02 - Title.mkv`).
  - **All videos** in one sortable table, and **Folders** as they're laid out on disk.
  - **Search** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>) across titles, shows, episodes and plots.
- **Details and pictures:** names from file and folder names, then Kodi-style `.nfo`
  files (`movie.nfo`, `tvshow.nfo`, `<name>.nfo`), then optionally
  [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org) with your own free API key. Posters and thumbnails
  come from images beside the videos (`poster.jpg`, `<name>-poster.jpg`,
  `<name>-thumb.jpg`, and `fanart.jpg` or `<name>-fanart.jpg` behind a movie or show's
  page), from TMDB, or a frame grabbed from the video. **Fix match**
  picks the right TMDB entry when the guess is wrong.
- **Playback** with mpv: hardware decoding, every format mpv plays, and speed from
  0.25× to 3× with the pitch kept.
  - **Resume:** each video starts where it was stopped and is marked watched near the
    end. Near the end (or once a Credits chapter starts) an Up next card counts down
    to the next episode, with Play now and Cancel.
  - **Seeking:** <kbd>←</kbd>/<kbd>→</kbd>, <kbd>0</kbd>–<kbd>9</kbd> for a tenth of the
    way through, two-finger swipes on a touchpad, and a seek bar that previews the
    frame under the pointer. Chapters show as ticks on the seek bar, in a Chapters menu,
    and with <kbd>Page Up</kbd>/<kbd>Page Down</kbd>. Click the length to see the time
    left; the player also says when the video will end.
  - **Subtitles:** picked up from files beside the video (`.srt`, `.ass`, `.vtt`…) or
    loaded by hand, with styled ASS, a delay you can nudge, a size setting and an
    optional dark background. They move up out of the way while the controls show.
    Each video remembers its subtitle and sound tracks.
  - **Picture:** override the shape (16:9, 4:3, 2.35:1…), fill the window, turn it, or
    deinterlace it.
  - **Sound:** a delay for videos whose sound is out of step, night mode to even out
    loud and quiet parts, and an optional boost up to 150%.
  - Fullscreen, frame stepping, controls that fade away while the video plays, and
    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> to save the frame on screen to your pictures folder.
  - **Web addresses** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>): streams, and video pages through
    yt-dlp when it's installed.
  - The screen stays awake while a video plays.
- **Drag and drop:** drop videos, folders or M3U playlists on the window to play them
  (hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to add them to the queue).
- **Queue and playlists:** play next or add to the queue from any video's right-click
  menu, make playlists, drag videos onto them in the sidebar, and import or export M3U.
- **Equalizer:** ten bands and a preamp, with presets and your own saved ones. It opens from the top bar.
- **Media keys and the bar:** MPRIS, so media keys, `playerctl` and status bars control
  it and show what's playing.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/design-nexus/nexus-media-player/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs GTK 4, mpv and ffmpeg if they're missing, builds with Cargo, and installs
`media-player` to `~/.local/bin` along with a launcher entry. Add `-s -- --default`
after `bash` to also make it the default app for video files.

To remove it, run the same line with `uninstall.sh` in place of `install.sh`. Add
`-s -- --purge` to also remove its settings, library database and playlists. Your video
files are never touched.
